# Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-09-10
**Current phase:** Phase 0 — Foundation (in progress, ~40% — see §1)
**Repo state:** Monorepo scaffolded. `product/api` has a working Express +
TypeScript + Prisma backend with auth/session/audit/permission-check
implemented, dependency-installed, typechecked, built, and smoke-tested over
real HTTP. `product/web` does not exist yet. No real Postgres database has
been provisioned or migrated against yet — see §1 for exactly what has and
hasn't been verified.

---

## 1. What exists right now

### Docs
- `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md` — complete, internally-consistent master
  specification. Treat as the locked reference for "what to build." Has a
  signed-off "IMPLEMENTATION APPROVAL" section at the end — Phase 0 work is
  authorized.
- `docs/PHASE_TRACKER.md` — scannable phase-by-phase checklist.
- `docs/README.md` — index / reading order / standing conventions.
- `docs/archive/` — planning docs from a prior, discarded attempt
  (codenamed `D:\sm`) that used a different multi-tenant architecture. Not
  applicable to this codebase. Reference only, never authoritative.

### `product/api` (Express + TypeScript + Prisma) — VERIFIED WORKING

What's actually built and confirmed (not just written — see "How this was
verified" below):

- **Prisma schema** (`product/api/prisma/schema.prisma`) — all 10 Phase 0
  models from the spec (Permission, Role, RolePermission, UserRole, Session,
  AuditLog, ApprovalRequest, Document, Notification, NotificationPreference)
  **plus a `User` model** (see "Deviations from spec" below). `prisma generate`
  succeeds; schema is valid Prisma/PostgreSQL.
- **Auth** (`src/modules/auth/`) — login, refresh (with rotation), logout,
  MFA setup/confirm (TOTP via otplib). Argon2id password hashing. Access
  token = short-lived JWT; refresh token = opaque random string, only its
  SHA-256 hash stored (`Session.refreshTokenHash`), rotated on every refresh.
  httpOnly+secure+sameSite=strict cookies for access/refresh; a separate
  non-httpOnly CSRF cookie for the double-submit CSRF check.
- **Middleware**: `authenticate` (verifies access token + confirms the
  backing Session isn't revoked/expired — this is what makes "password/role
  change invalidates all sessions" take effect immediately, not just at next
  token expiry), `authorize(permissionKey)` (Role→Permission check only —
  Scope/Context/State layers are explicitly deferred to Phase 1+ per a
  comment in the code, not silently skipped), `csrfProtection`
  (double-submit cookie), rate limiters (5/min on login — per-IP, not
  per-account, per spec correction #15 to avoid lockout-DoS), centralized
  error handler (maps `HttpError` and `ZodError` to proper JSON responses).
- **Audit** (`src/lib/audit.ts`) — `writeAuditLog()` helper that redacts
  password/token/secret fields before writing, per spec's "audit log never
  stores secrets" rule. Wired into login/logout today; not yet wired into
  every mutation (nothing else mutates yet).
- **Seed script** (`prisma/seed.ts`) — creates the 7 core roles and Phase 0's
  permission set, grants all of them to `SUPER_ADMIN`.
- **Bootstrap script** (`scripts/create-super-admin.ts`) — creates the first
  Super Admin user (no self-registration, by design).
- **Tests** (`tests/*.test.ts`) — 16 passing: password hashing round-trip +
  policy, token sign/verify/tamper-detection, refresh token hashing, CSRF
  token uniqueness, and one supertest hit on `/health`. These do **not**
  require a database (Prisma client is never called in them).

**Not built yet within Phase 0:**
- Role/Permission management API (create/edit/archive/assign — currently
  only seed-time creation exists)
- ApprovalRequest create/decide API (model exists, no service/routes)
- Document upload API (model exists, no service/routes)
- Notification dispatch — in-app + email (model exists, no service/routes)
- Any DB-backed integration test (login → session → refresh → logout against
  a real Postgres) — blocked on a real database being provisioned

### `product/web` — does not exist yet

No Next.js app has been scaffolded. This is next after Phase 0's backend is
further along, or can be started in parallel — see §3.

### How this was verified (not just "should work")

In this session, with dependencies actually installed against a real npm
registry:
- `npm install` — clean, 0 vulnerabilities (see §6 for the dependency
  security fixes applied)
- `npx prisma generate` — succeeds against the schema
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — no type errors
- `npm run build` — compiles to `dist/` with no errors
- `npx vitest run` — 16/16 tests pass
- **Booted the built server and hit it over real HTTP**: `GET /health` →
  200 with correct Helmet security headers and CORS headers; malformed
  `POST /api/v1/auth/login` → 400 with proper Zod field errors; rate-limit
  headers present and counting down correctly.

What was **not** verified (no Postgres instance available in this
environment): actual DB-backed login (user lookup, session creation,
argon2 verify against a real stored hash), refresh rotation against a real
Session row, or the seed/bootstrap scripts actually writing to a database.
**Do not claim these work until they've been run against a real Postgres.**

## 2. Decided tech stack (from PRODUCT_SPEC.md §3)

**Installed and verified in `product/api`:** express, prisma/@prisma/client
5.22.0 (pinned to latest stable — an 8.0.0-rc is available but RC builds are
not used for production-track work), argon2 0.41 (Argon2id), jsonwebtoken,
otplib (TOTP/MFA), helmet, cors, cookie-parser, express-rate-limit, zod,
vitest 5 + supertest, tsx, typescript 5.6. Exact versions in
`product/api/package.json`.

**Not yet installed:** anything for `product/web` (Next.js, shadcn/ui, React
Hook Form, TanStack Table, Recharts, Sonner) — that app doesn't exist yet.


**Frontend:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), React 18+, TypeScript 5+, Tailwind
CSS 3+, shadcn/ui, Lucide icons, React Hook Form + Zod, TanStack Table,
Recharts, Sonner.

**Backend:** Node.js 20+, Express.js, TypeScript 5+, PostgreSQL 15+,
Prisma 5+, Zod, JWT (access + refresh, httpOnly cookies + CSRF per §8),
Vitest + Supertest.

**Architecture:** Modular monolith (not microservices), single-tenant
deployment (one customer = one isolated deployment they host themselves).

**Planned repo layout:**
```
product/
  web/        # Next.js frontend (customer-facing app, all 7 roles)
  api/        # Express backend
platform/
  web/        # Provider control panel frontend (Phase 10)
  api/        # Provider control panel backend (Phase 10)
packages/
  shared/     # Shared types, Zod schemas, utilities
docs/
```

## 3. Immediate next action

Pick one (neither blocks the other, but the first is smaller):

1. **Provision a real PostgreSQL database** (local Docker, or a hosted dev
   instance), point `product/api/.env`'s `DATABASE_URL` at it, run
   `npm run prisma:migrate --workspace=product/api -- --name init`, then the
   seed and bootstrap scripts (see root `README.md`). This unblocks writing
   real DB-backed integration tests for the auth flow — currently the
   biggest unverified risk area.
2. **Finish the rest of Phase 0's backend surface**: Role/Permission
   management API, ApprovalRequest create/decide API, Document upload API,
   Notification dispatch API. Each should follow the same pattern already
   established in `src/modules/auth/` (service.ts / controller.ts /
   routes.ts, zod-validated input, `authorize()` on every mutating route,
   `writeAuditLog()` on every state change per §8's "MUST AUDIT" list).

`product/web` (Next.js + shadcn/ui) has not been started — reasonable to
begin once there's something real to log into (i.e. after item 1 above), or
in parallel by a different session.

## 3a. Deviations from PRODUCT_SPEC.md (and why)

- **Added a `User` model to Phase 0's schema.** The spec's Model Ownership
  Table lists 10 Phase 0 tables and never explicitly names `User`, even
  though `UserRole`, `Session`, `AuditLog.actorId`, `ApprovalRequest`, and
  `Document.uploadedBy` all require one. Clear spec oversight — Phase 0
  cannot ship login without an identity table. Documented directly in
  `schema.prisma`'s header comment too.
- **`UserRole.campusId` is a bare nullable string, no FK.** Campus doesn't
  exist until Phase 1. It'll gain a real relation then — same pattern the
  spec itself used for moving `InchargeScope` from Phase 0 to Phase 1.

## 4. Standing decisions (do not re-litigate without a real reason)

- Single-tenant only. No multi-tenant mode, ever, in this codebase.
- Customer owns hosting, domain, database. Provider never touches customer
  operational data. License validated locally (signed JWT, RS256), heartbeat
  is async/non-blocking.
- 7 core roles (Super Admin, Principal, Incharge, Office, Teacher, Parent,
  Student). Incharge scope is dynamic (many-to-many, overlap allowed) — never
  hardcode "one incharge per range."
- Authorization = Role + Permission + Scope + Context + State. Role alone
  never grants access.
- No hard deletes on financial/academic/identity records — archive/void/
  reverse/withdraw instead, always audited.
- Student ≠ Enrollment. Invoice ≠ Payment ≠ Receipt. Never merge these.

## 5. Dependency security notes

- `npm install` initially reported 7 vulnerabilities (5 moderate, 1 high, 1
  critical): a `qs` DoS/bypass issue via Express's transitive dependency, and
  a `vitest`/`vite`/`esbuild` dev-server path-traversal chain (dev-only,
  never runs in production, but fixed anyway).
- Fixed via: root `package.json` `overrides: { "qs": "6.16.0" }`, and bumping
  `vitest` to `^5.0.0` in `product/api/package.json`. Required a clean
  `node_modules`/lockfile reinstall for the override to actually resolve —
  `npm audit fix` alone did not apply it.
- Current state: **0 vulnerabilities** (`npm audit`). Re-run `npm audit`
  periodically as new phases add dependencies.
- This environment gates native/postinstall scripts (Prisma client
  generation, argon2's native build, esbuild) behind an `allowScripts` field
  in the root `package.json` — already approved for the packages that need
  it. If a future `npm install` reports "packages have install scripts not
  yet covered," run `npm approve-scripts <pkg>` for legitimate build tools
  (Prisma, argon2, esbuild, native modules) after checking what the script
  actually does — don't blanket-approve without looking.

## 6. Session log

Append a dated entry every session. Keep entries short — what changed, what's
left, anything the next session needs to know that isn't obvious from the
code/docs themselves.

### 2026-09-10 (c) — Phase 0 backend scaffold: auth/session/audit/authorize

- Scaffolded the monorepo: root `package.json` (npm workspaces), `.gitignore`,
  `product/api` (Express+TS+Prisma), `packages/shared` (empty placeholder).
- Wrote Phase 0's Prisma schema (10 spec models + `User`, see §3a deviation),
  and implemented: password hashing (Argon2id), JWT access tokens, opaque
  hashed+rotated refresh tokens, Session-backed `authenticate` middleware,
  permission-based `authorize()` middleware (Role+Permission only — Scope/
  Context/State deferred to Phase 1+ by design, not oversight), double-submit
  CSRF, per-IP login rate limiting, MFA (TOTP) setup/confirm, redacting audit
  log writer, a Phase 0 seed script (7 roles + permissions), and a
  create-super-admin bootstrap script.
- Verified for real: `npm install` (0 vulnerabilities after fixing qs +
  vitest advisories — see §5), `prisma generate`, `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run
  build`, `vitest run` (16/16 passing), and booted the built server to
  confirm `/health` and `/api/v1/auth/login` actually respond correctly over
  HTTP with proper security headers, CORS, and validation errors.
- **Not done / explicitly deferred:** no real Postgres was available in this
  environment, so DB-backed behavior (actual login round-trip, session
  rows, seed/bootstrap scripts writing data) is unverified — do not assume
  it works without testing against a real database first. Role/Permission
  management, Approval, Document, and Notification APIs are not built yet
  (models exist, no service/routes). `product/web` doesn't exist yet.
- **Next session should:** provision Postgres and verify the DB-backed auth
  flow end-to-end, or continue building out the remaining Phase 0 API
  surface — see §3.

### 2026-09-10 (b) — Spec verified against original requirements, approved

- Cross-checked `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` end-to-end against the user's original,
  independently-written requirements dump (roles, permission model, UI
  screens/sidebars per role, workflows, business rules) to confirm the phase
  division actually reflects what was asked for. No gaps or contradictions
  found — the spec already matches faithfully.
- Closed the spec's own "PENDING HUMAN APPROVAL" gate: added an
  "IMPLEMENTATION APPROVAL" section at the end of `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` recording
  the user's explicit go-ahead. Phase 0 is now authorized to start.
- **Next action:** scaffold the Phase 0 monorepo skeleton and begin
  implementing Phase 0 models/middleware per `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.

### 2026-09-10 (a) — Docs reorganized for fresh start

- Discovered this repo (`D:\my Product`) was empty except for `docs/` copied
  from a different, unrelated repo (`D:\sm`) that has real (but architecturally
  different, multi-tenant) code and in-progress work. User confirmed: ignore
  `D:\sm`, this repo starts from zero code, spec-only.
- Archived the 4 docs that described migrating `D:\sm`'s multi-tenant code
  (`ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`,
  `SPEC_CORRECTIONS_APPLIED.md`, old `BUILD_STATE.md`) into `docs/archive/` —
  none of it applies to a zero-code repo.
- Created `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file), `PHASE_TRACKER.md`, and `README.md`
  as the new living status/index docs so any future agent can orient itself
  without re-deriving context.
- No code written. No dependencies installed. No commits made yet (repo has
  zero commits — first commit is still pending, awaiting user go-ahead).
- **Next session should:** confirm with the user whether to scaffold the
  Phase 0 monorepo skeleton, then start implementing Phase 0 per
  `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.
